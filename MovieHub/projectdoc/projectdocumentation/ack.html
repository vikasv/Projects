            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>CS5610: WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>

                I strongly believe taking this course has opened a new career option for me. The course has

                been a great source of required tools and technologies for a novice like me to equip myself for

                an exciting career in web development field. Experiments were really helpful to play around

                and learn myself. I am sure this course has given me deeper understanding and also confidence

                to develop quality websites from the scratch on my own.

                <h3>Prof. Richard Rasala</h3>

                I admire Prof. Rasala for his motivation and enthusiasm during his lectures. He has handles the

                course very well and the course structure was designed in such a way that a student can get the

                best out of him while doing experiments for learning and finally developing a project to

                implement all the topic explored.

                <br />
                <br />

                My special thanks to Professor for understanding my situation at the end of course and

                allowing me to change my project. His support during my crisis time has been a great

                encouragement and helped me a lot in finishing my project in time and also with confidence.

                <h3>Prof. Jose Annunziato</h3>

                Experiment’s posted on Prof. Jose’s YouTube channel were a good source of information and

                were always my preferred reference when in doubt. I have been a regular viewer of Prof. Jose’s

                videos and I appreciate the effort put in towards creating the videos which are really very

                helpful for me and many more students like me.

                <h3>TA – Jagruti Kapadia</h3>

                I want to thank my TA Jagruti for her useful reviews about my experiments and project. I really

                admired her web development skills and hence used to learn from her work and improve based

                upon her suggestions.
                <br /><br />
                And also special thanks to my friends Kaushik and Sujith for their valuable time in suggesting ideas for

                my project and also for their comments in making my site aesthetic.
